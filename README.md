# Freeze Monitor

Freeze Monitor is a simple tool for monitoring system freezes. It simply measures
how much a thread put to sleep misses its wake up. If the deviation is more than
given threshold then it's considered as a freeze.

My first Windows app since 90's and my first C# app ever so please excuse the
code quality :D
